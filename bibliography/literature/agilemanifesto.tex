% Relevant notes
The manifesto for agile development is basically a list of four statements which show the value of the elements in them. 
In all cases, left is valued more then right, even though all do have value.
The items are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  \item Working software over comprehensive documentation
  \item Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  \item Responding to change over following a plan
\end{itemize}

This is the result of summarising several principles, which can be found on the website \cite{agilemanifesto}.
