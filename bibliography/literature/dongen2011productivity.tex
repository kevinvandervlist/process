\chapter{Productivity in Scrum: A case study \cite{dongen2011productivity}}
\section{Notes}
Scrum based on self defined iterations, loosening tight control structures. 
Supporters say managing complexity and cognitive complexities is undoable.
Principles such as eliminating waste, amplifying learning and empowering the team are core values in Scrum.
Claims about greater job satisfaction and increased productivity\footnote{because of short feedback loop} are also made, but neither are very clear.

Scrum works best if teams are kept small and if there are plenty of informal communication means. 
The teams work closely together, increasing their informal communication even more. 
It enhances mutual communication, increasing mutual understanding.
