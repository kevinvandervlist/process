\chapter{A Literature Review of Agile Practices and Their Effects in Scientific Software Development \cite{recentagile}}
\section{Notes}
% Relevant notes
This paper describes a study on the effects of Agile and XP on software development \emph{outside} the Software Engineering field. 
Some papers were selected by the authors, and a questionnaire was used to get answers from the authors and programmers of the papers. 

The paper analyses whether agile approaches have a effect on scientific development. 
Even though the study itself is not conclusive, the results it puts forward can be seen as a nice indication. 
This indication suggests a positive effect of applying the agile approach, even outside the domain of SE.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Is there a difference in Agile in and out of the SE domain?
  \item How do other scientific fields cope with software development?
\end{itemize}

\section{Review}
% Optional: review why fellow students have to read it
This paper is a nice document regarding the effect of agile approaches on software development \emph{outside} its normal field, which is our own. 
It is interesting to see that quite a number of agile approaches are applied, and these applied practices might be seen as a slimmed down, practically proven way of doing agile development. 
Apparently, other fields see the value of Agile as well.
