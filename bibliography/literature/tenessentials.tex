The Essence of an Effective Development Process.

% Relevant notes
This white paper tries to give a high level overview for people new to the RUP process world. 
Because of all the different artefacts RUP has, people starting with the process tend to ``get lost'' in the analysing phase of projects. 
From the plethora of artefacts\footnote{The documents mentions a lot more then 100}, which do I choose?

By providing a shortlist of ten essential components that can serve as a basis, this initial approach is made easier.
The idea of this shortlist is not to provide a rigid foundation, but more to use it as a starting point. 
One can use it, and then refine it to end up with his or her own list of essentials.
